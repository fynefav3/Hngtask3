About the codebase
The project was built with React Native CLI. React Native is an open-source UI software development kit created by Facebook. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, and the web from a single codebase. Before building a react native application a knowledge of javascript is required as the code is written in javascript. The instructions are a bit different depending on your development operating system, and whether you want to start developing for iOS or Android. If you want to develop for both Android and iOS, that's fine - you can pick one to start with, since the setup is a bit different.
